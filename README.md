# IMDb Sentiment Analysis with NLP

In this project, I developed sentiment analysis software using NLP. In this study, I used the dataset I got from Kaggle. Thanks to the software I developed, IMDb movie reviews in English that come with this data set automatically get positive or negative comments. We have an approximate 85% success rate.
